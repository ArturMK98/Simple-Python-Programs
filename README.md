# Simple Python Programs
Below is a list of some simple Python programs that I wrote when I was learning the Python basics and its syntax.

## [AreaTriangle](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/AreaTriangle.py)
- A Python program that prompts the user to enter 3 sides of a triangle and prints out the area of that triangle.

## [Hello World](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/HelloWorld.py)
- A Python program that prints "Hello Wrold" to the screen.

## [QuadraticEqn](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/QuadraticEqn.py)
- A Python program that prompts that user to enter 3 values (a,b,c) and solves the quadratic equation given the values entered by the user.

## [RandomNum](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/RandomNum.py)
- A Python program that generates a random number between 0 and 1000000 and prints it out to the screen

## [SimpleCalculator](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/SimpleCalculator.py)
- A python program that can perfom addition, subtraction, multiplication or division on two numbers based on user input.

## [SquareRoot](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/SquareRoot.py)
- A python program that calculates and prints out the square root of a number inputted by the user.

## [Sum](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/Sum.py)
- A Python program that calculates and prints out the sum of 2 integers inputted by the user.

## [Swap](https://github.com/ArturMK98/Simple-Python-Programs/blob/master/Swap.py)
- A Python program that prompts the user to enter two variables (x,y), swaps the values in x and y with eachother and prints the contents of x and y to the screen.
